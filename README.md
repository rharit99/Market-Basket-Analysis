# Association Rule Mining Project

**Submitted by:** Rachita Harit

## Project Description

This project applies association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from a retail dataset. The insights gained can help in dynamic pricing, enhancing customer shopping experiences, and targeting marketing campaigns.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following library:

pip install apyori

## Usage

1. **Load the necessary libraries:**
    - Import pandas and the Apriori algorithm from the apyori library.

2. **Load the datasets:**
    - Load `products.csv`, `order_products__train.csv`, and `orders.csv`.
    - Ensure the datasets are loaded correctly by checking their expected column counts.

3. **Prepare the transaction data:**
    - Merge the `order_products_train` dataset with the `products` dataset to link product names with each order.
    - Group the data by `order_id` and collect all product names associated with each order.

4. **Run the Apriori algorithm:**
    - Specify the minimum support and confidence values.
    - Execute the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

5. **Analyze the results:**
    - Print out the discovered rules, including support, confidence, and lift values.
    - Use the insights to inform business recommendations such as dynamic pricing strategies, enhanced customer experiences, and focused promotional campaigns.

## Business Recommendations
Based on the discovered association rules, the following recommendations can enhance business outcomes:

### ðŸ’¸ Dynamic Pricing Strategies:
- **Implement dynamic pricing models** based on frequently bought-together items.
- Use **variable pricing and flash sales** to maximize profits and increase sales volume.

### ðŸ›’ Enhanced Customer Experience Initiatives:
- Offer **personalized shopping lists** and **smart shopping carts** to suggest items based on past purchases.
- Train customer service representatives to **upsell and cross-sell** based on common item associations.

### ðŸ“ˆ Focused Promotional Campaigns:
- Design **marketing campaigns** that highlight products frequently bought together.
- Use **tailored email campaigns**, **special discount offers**, and **loyalty program enhancements** to drive sales.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of association rule mining to derive valuable business insights from retail transaction data. By leveraging the Apriori algorithm, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize pricing, improve customer experience, and design effective marketing strategies.
